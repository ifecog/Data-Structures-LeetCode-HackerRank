a restaurant ha launched an app for their food delivery. 'n' reviews about various of their menu items have been submitted. Users have submitted a rating out of 5 (1 being the worst and 5 being the best) The manager wants to know the most loved dish in the menu. Find out the dish with the highest rating . Note: if 2 dishes are rated the same, return the dish with the smaller id. n represents the number of reviews. def solution (n, ratings):
    
    # Write your code here
    pass

n = int(input())
ratings = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)]

out_ = solution(n, ratings)
print (out_)

To find the dish with the highest rating while considering the dish's ID in case of a tie, you can use the following Python function:

python

def solution(n, ratings):
    dish_ratings = {}
    
    for review in ratings:
        dish_id, rating = review[0], review[1]
        
        if dish_id not in dish_ratings:
            dish_ratings[dish_id] = 0
        
        dish_ratings[dish_id] += rating
    
    max_rating = -1
    best_dish = None
    
    for dish_id, rating_sum in dish_ratings.items():
        if rating_sum > max_rating or (rating_sum == max_rating and dish_id < best_dish):
            max_rating = rating_sum
            best_dish = dish_id
    
    return best_dish

# Input
n = int(input())
ratings = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)]

# Output
out_ = solution(n, ratings)
print(out_)

This code will read the input, calculate the total ratings for each dish, and then determine the dish with the highest rating. If there is a tie in ratings, it will select the dish with the smaller ID.
