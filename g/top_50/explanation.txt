We are given an m x n matrix points, where points[r][c] represents the points we can gain by selecting the cell at row r and column c. The goal is to maximize the total points by selecting one cell in each row. However, there's a penalty for selecting cells that are far apart in adjacent rows. Specifically:

If we select cell (r, c1) in row r and cell (r + 1, c2) in row r + 1, we lose abs(c1 - c2) points.

Our task is to compute the maximum points we can achieve under these constraints.

Key Observations
Row-by-Row Selection: We must select exactly one cell in each row.

Penalty for Column Distance: The penalty depends on the absolute difference in column indices between adjacent rows.

Dynamic Programming: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming (DP) because the optimal solution for a row depends on the choices made in the previous row.

Approach
We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. Here's the step-by-step plan:

DP State Definition:

Let dp[r][c] represent the maximum points we can achieve up to row r if we select cell (r, c) in row r.

Base Case:

For the first row (r = 0), dp[0][c] = points[0][c] because there are no penalties.

Transition:

For each row r > 0 and each column c, we need to consider all possible columns prev_c in the previous row and compute:

Copy
dp[r][c] = points[r][c] + max(dp[r-1][prev_c] - abs(c - prev_c))
This ensures that we account for the penalty when transitioning from (r-1, prev_c) to (r, c).

Final Result:

The answer will be the maximum value in the last row of the dp table, i.e., max(dp[m-1][c] for all c).

Optimization:

To avoid recomputing the maximum for each cell, we can precompute the best possible dp[r-1][prev_c] - abs(c - prev_c) for each column c using prefix and suffix maximums.
