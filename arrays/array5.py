Why does it feel like I won a lottery?... finally getting a reply from you 

I do not intend to bother you or take things fast... Just, once in a while, you come across someone, and you really admire them and want to connect... maybe even more along the line lol. So, again, I really want to be friends with you and I wouldn't bug you... actually, if you wouldn't mind, I could be of help in a lot of ways lol... and I really mean that. If your answer is No, I'll take my L and walk.
